A graphical application for scientific programming using TraitsUI 4 and the Qt toolkit
======================================================================================

This a Qt adaptation of Gael Varoquaux's tutorial :

The code for embedding Matplotlib in a Qt-based TraitsUI application using Qt has been shared by Didrik Pinte in May 2012 (http://markmail.org/message/z3hnoqruk56g2bje) and adapted and tested to work with PySide from Anaconda by Pierre Haessig in March 2014 (https://gist.github.com/pierre-haessig/9838326).
