A graphical application for scientific programming using TraitsUI 4 and the Qt toolkit
======================================================================================

This is a Qt adaptation of GaÃ«l Varoquaux's tutorial :
https://github.com/enthought/traitsui/tree/master/docs/source/tutorials

The code for embedding a Matplotlib figure into a Qt-based TraitsUI application has been shared by Didrik Pinte in May 2012 (http://markmail.org/message/z3hnoqruk56g2bje) and adapted and tested to work with PySide from Anaconda by Pierre Haessig in March 2014 (https://gist.github.com/pierre-haessig/9838326).
